# ProductCard With API and Refactor using useContext

This project implements a `ProductCard` component that uses an external API to retrieve product data and leverages React's `useContext` to manage state more efficiently and structurally.

## Key Features

- **Data Retrieval from API**: 
  - Integrates with an API to retrieve real-time product data, ensuring up-to-date information display.

- **Refactor with useContext**:
  - Uses `useContext` for improved global state management, reducing prop drilling and enhancing code readability and maintainability.
  - Organizes state in the context, making data access and management efficient across various components.

- **Modular Design**:
  - Features a modular code structure with separate components, facilitating easier development and maintenance.
  - Allows for the addition of new features or changes without impacting other parts of the application.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **useContext**: React hook for global state management.
- **API Fetching**: Fetching data from an external API using Axios.
